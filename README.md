- File handling functionality to open and save text files.
- Keyboard shortcuts to perform common actions (e.g., opening and saving files).
- Simple and lightweight design.

## Requirements

- Operating System: Windows
- FASM (Flat Assembler)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Assemble the source code using FASM.
3. Run the compiled executable to launch the text editor.

## File Structure

- `texteditor.asm`: Contains the main assembly code for the text editor.
- `win32w.inc`: Include file with declarations and constants from the Win32 API.
- `README.md`: This file.
